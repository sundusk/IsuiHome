# Mission Control

IsuiHome Mission Control centralizes four operational surfaces:
1. Tasks Board: Kanban-style visualization sourced from HEARTBEAT priorities.
2. Calendar: Combined view of cron schedules and upcoming task due dates.
3. Memory: Searchable timeline of memories and system logs.
4. Team: Agent roster for Isui, Jarvis, and MC with role/status visibility.

Design direction:
- Clean, modern UI
- Ice/Blue palette for Isui identity
- Live data via Convex where configured
